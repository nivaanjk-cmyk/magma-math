# 

A versatile, "internet hub"; The point of this project is to eliminate the need to search multiple websites for different things by packing together tools, apps, as well as entertainment and private browsing, all in one place. This is particularly useful for people who are lazy and want a "hub" that includes everything that they need to enjoy the internet.


Many of our tools, apps, entertainment, etc. is requested through our Discord community or added through pull requests. We recommend making PRs to help out and contribute!


> [!CAUTION]
> Although this is an "internet hub", we do **not** include illegal, piracy, or copyright-infringing tools or apps.

> ⭐ Star this repository if you are forking it, or find it useful!

### Development & Building
niv
dogeub can be easily deployed as a web application. Use the commands below to run it for production, or for developing.

> [!WARNING]

#### Production:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xorynix/dogeub.git
cd dogeub
npm i
npm run build
node server.js
```

#### Development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xorynix/dogeub.git
cd dogeub
npm i
npm run dev
```
---

#### Deploying with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name dogeub \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e PORT=3000 \
  ghcr.io/xorynix/dogeub:latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> If accessing over a network instead of localhost, you will need to provide a valid SSL certificate (e.g., using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy). This is required for the built-in service worker to function properly.
